# Memetrex

Product Name: Memetrex

Purpose: Increases memory, causing you to literally remember everything

**How to Use**

Memetrex is available in the form of Pepe-embossed, green elliptical tablets. The recommended dosage is one tablet taken orally with a glass of water, preferably while browsing your favorite meme database for mental stimulation. For optimal results, take Memetrex 30 minutes before engaging in memory-intensive activities, such as trivia night or an epic meme showdown.

**Side Effects**

Some potential side effects of Memetrex may include:

1. The sudden ability to recall every meme you've ever encountered, even the cringiest ones
2. An uncanny knack for winning online arguments by recalling obscure Pepe references
3. A newfound obsession with pop culture history, particularly as it relates to memes
4. The inability to forget embarrassing moments, both your own and those of others
5. The occasional urge to recite meme-related trivia at inappropriate moments

Consult your memologist if side effects persist or become bothersome.

**Precautions**

Before taking Memetrex, consider the following precautions:

1. Do not use Memetrex if you have a known allergy to dank memes or a history of meme-induced flashbacks.
2. Memetrex may not be suitable for individuals with a propensity for meme-related nightmares or those who wish to forget their past meme blunders.
3. Exercise caution when engaging in social situations, as Memetrex may cause users to inadvertently recall and share embarrassing memories.

**Interactions**

Memetrex may interact with other substances or activities, including:

1. Memory suppressants: Combining Memetrex with memory suppressants may result in an epic meme battle for mental dominance and unpredictable memory performance.
2. Binge-watching TV shows: The combination of Memetrex and binge-watching may cause an overload of pop culture references, leading to an irresistible urge to create crossover memes.

Consult your memologist if you are taking any other medications or participating in any activities that may interfere with Memetrex's effectiveness.

**Overdose**

In case of an overdose, symptoms may include:

1. A photographic memory of every meme ever created, resulting in an overwhelming desire to create a comprehensive meme encyclopedia
2. The belief that you are the ultimate meme archivist, destined to preserve dank memes for future generations
3. The inability to separate meme memories from your own life experiences

If you suspect an overdose, contact your local meme crisis hotline or visit the nearest meme rehabilitation center. Remember, the key to enjoying Memetrex is to use it responsibly and to cherish the unparalleled meme wisdom of our legendary Pepe: "With great meme-ory comes great responsibility."
