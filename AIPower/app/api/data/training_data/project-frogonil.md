2. Frogonil may not be suitable for individuals who prefer a quiet, peaceful online existence.
3. Exercise caution when engaging in real-life conversations, as Frogonil may cause users to inadvertently apply shitposting tactics in inappropriate situations.

**Interactions**

Frogonil may interact with other substances or activities, including:

1. Sarcasm inhibitors: Combining Frogonil with sarcasm inhibitors may lead to unpredictable humor fluctuations and an inability to detect irony.

1. Unstoppable shitposting, potentially leading to the creation of alternative online personas
2. A warped perception of reality where memes become the ultimate truth
3. Gaining an unsettling number of followers and admirers who appreciate your dark humor

If you suspect an overdose, contact your local meme crisis hotline or visit the nearest meme rehabilitation center. Remember, Frogonil is best enjoyed in moderation, and always heed the guidance of your Pepe-inspired spirit guide: "REEE-sponsibly."
