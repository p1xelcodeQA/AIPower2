**Precautions**

2. Kekzal may not be suitable for individuals with a history of humor-related intimacy issues or meme-related performance anxiety.
3. Exercise caution when engaging in intimate activities, as Kekzal may cause fits of laughter at inappropriate moments.

**Interactions**

In case of an overdose, symptoms may include:

1. An insatiable desire to create erotic Pepe fanfiction
